Note: Assume that Chef and Chefina were born on same day and same month (just different year).

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single integer 𝑋, the age of Chef.
Output Format
For each test case, output Chefina's age when Chef will be X years old.

Constraints
1≤𝑇≤25
25≤𝑋≤50

Sample 1:
Input: 4
      25
      36
      50
      44

Output
       15
       26
       40
       34
Explanation:
Test case 1: 
Chefina is 10 years old when Chef is 20years old. Thus, when Chef would be 25, Chefina would be 15.


Test case 2: 
Chefina is 10 years old when Chef is 20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be 36, Chefina would be 26.

Test case 3: 
Chefina is 10 years old when Chef is 20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be 50, Chefina would be 40.

Test case 4: 
Chefina is 10 years old when Chef is 20 years old. Thus, when Chef would be 44, Chefina would be 34.
